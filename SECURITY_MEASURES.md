# Security Measures Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to prevent users from accessing right-click context menus, using keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+U, or using browser developer tools to inspect the webpage.

## Implemented Measures

### 1. Disabled Right-Click Context Menu
- Event listeners prevent the default context menu from appearing when right-clicking anywhere on the page.

### 2. Blocked Keyboard Shortcuts
The following keyboard shortcuts have been disabled:
- `Ctrl+U` (View page source)
- `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Open developer tools)
- `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Inspect element)
- `F12` (Open developer tools)

### 3. DevTools Detection
- The application monitors window size differences to detect when developer tools might be open.
- When detected, the page content is replaced with a warning message.

### 4. Console Warnings
- Console is periodically cleared and displays warning messages.

### 5. Disabled Text Selection
- CSS properties prevent text selection throughout the application.

### 6. No-Cache Headers
- Meta tags prevent browsers from caching the page.

## Limitations

It's important to understand that these measures are deterrents rather than foolproof security:

1. **Advanced Users**: Technically savvy users can still bypass these measures by:
   - Disabling JavaScript
   - Using browser extensions that override these restrictions
   - Accessing the page source through browser cache files
   - Using specialized tools designed to extract web content

2. **Accessibility Impact**: These measures may negatively impact accessibility for users who rely on certain browser features.

3. **Mobile Limitations**: Some of these techniques may not work consistently across all mobile browsers.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Different browsers implement security features differently, so some measures may not work in all browsers.

## Maintenance Considerations

When updating the application, be aware that:
- These security measures are implemented in `SecurityRestrictions.tsx` component
- CSS restrictions are in `globals.css`
- Meta tags are in `layout.tsx`

Any changes to these files should preserve the security measures or enhance them as needed.
