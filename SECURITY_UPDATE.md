# Security Update

## Changes Made

1. **Modified SecurityRestrictions Component**
   - Removed the "Inspección no permitida" warning message that appeared when DevTools were detected
   - Kept all security restrictions including:
     - Disabled right-click context menu
     - Blocked keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+U, Ctrl+Shift+I, Ctrl+Shift+C, F12)
     - Console warning messages

2. **Re-implemented Security Restrictions**
   - Added the SecurityRestrictions component back to layout.tsx
   - This ensures that users cannot use right-click or keyboard shortcuts to inspect the page
   - No disruptive warning messages will appear if users attempt to use developer tools

## Result

The website now has the following security features:
- Right-click context menu is disabled
- Keyboard shortcuts for developer tools are blocked
- Console shows warning messages
- DevTools are still detected but no warning message replaces the page content

These changes satisfy the requirement to restrict inspection capabilities without showing the "Inspección no permitida" message that disrupts the user experience.
