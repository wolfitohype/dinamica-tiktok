# Changes Made to Remove Inspection Restrictions

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to remove the inspection restrictions from the website while keeping all other functionality intact.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed SecurityRestrictions Component**
   - Removed the import statement for SecurityRestrictions in `layout.tsx`
   - Removed the SecurityRestrictions component from the body element

2. **Restored Text Selection**
   - Removed user-select restrictions from the body element in `globals.css`
   - This allows users to select text normally on the page

3. **Restored Normal Cursor**
   - Removed the cursor-none class from the body element in `layout.tsx`
   - This restores the normal cursor behavior on the page

## Result
Users can now:
- Use right-click context menus
- Use keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+U, Ctrl+Shift+I, F12
- Open developer tools to inspect the page
- Select text on the page
- See the normal cursor

All other functionality and styling of the page remains unchanged.
